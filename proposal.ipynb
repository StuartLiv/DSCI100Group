    "### Introduction\n",
    "In our present day and age, climate change has become a non-negligible impact on human life. The possible impact of climate change on human health is increasingly acknowledged. (Auger et al., 2011). To reduce the damage caused by severe weather, people need to predict the future weather. Weather forecasting is essential for providing vital information about severe weather threats and risk management. (Weyn et al., 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, weather cannot be modeled simply by the qualitative phenomenon, but by quantitative measurements of weather instruments. The problem this project seeks to adress is that in isolation, quantitative measurements do not describe a qualitative pattern. Using k-nearest-neighbour classification, can weather be described as function of these quantitative measuremnts? If so, as this project will discuss, weather masurement as well as prediction can be further automated, since only quantitative measurements would need to be taken to fully describe the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use is on https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data. It includes data over separate csv files for different variables, like humidity.csv, pressure.csv etc. We are going to combine them into one dataset and focus on only city Vancouver with date-time, description of weather, humidity, pressure, and temperature."
